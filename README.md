# Project 2 DIY Instructions
Andy Spiers and Frank Whitworth

## Materials:
- 1x Arduino Uno
- 1x 9 Volt Battery 
- 1x 9 Volt Battery Clip 
- 1x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor 
- 1x Arduino Vibration Motor 
- 1x 5 by 3 by 1.5 inch cardboard box 
- 1x 2 by 2 inch 45 degree wooden handle

## Instructions:
1. Connect the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (Ultrasonic) to the Arduino Uno (Arduino), connecting the VCC pin to the 5V port on the Arduino and the GND pin to the GND port. Connect the Trig pin of the Ultrasonic to digital port 9, and the Echo pin of the Ultrasonic to digital port 9.
2. Connect the Arduino Vibration motor to the Arduino Uno by connecting red wire to digital port 6, and the blue wire to a GND port. Now that the electronics are complete, we need to make tebh device usable. 
3. Upload the code to the Arduino - find it here on GitHub 
4. Cut two holes in the side of the cardboard box, so that you can insert the ultrasonic sensor into the holes. 
5. Using hot glue, attach the 45 degree wooden handle to the bottom of the box, on the opposite side of the ultrasonic sensor.  
6. Cut an additional hole in the back of the box, opposite the Ultrasonic sensor, to thread the vibration motor through. Secure the vibration motor to the wooden handle using any adhesive. 
7.  Attach the battery to the Arduino Uno, and arrange the electronics in the cardboard box so you can close it
